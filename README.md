LM2

LM2 Online Judge project.

The CodeIgniter version of this project, named "LM2C" (by the way, it is named 'LM2C' before Apple released iPhone 5C :P), is considered finished and was up at http://kenrick95.org/lm2/ .

LM2 is currently up at http://pc.t15.org

The previous version of LM2 which was intended to be open-source ended up in failure because the coding style was very messy. This project is a combination of old system with new concept.

My concept is to make a (competitive programming) online judge which everyone can contribute: submit and solve problem(s) also write solution(s) to the problem(s).
