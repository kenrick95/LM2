LM2 Online Judge project; still in process of making

===
The previous version of LM2 which was intended to be open-source ended up in failure because the coding style was very messy. This project is a combination of old system with new concept.

My concept is to make a (competitive programming) online judge which everyone can contribute: submit and solve problem(s) also write solution(s) to the problem(s).
